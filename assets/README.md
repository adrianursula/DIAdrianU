# Asset Placeholder Note

The following placeholder images are needed for the app to run:
- `assets/icon.png` (1024x1024) - App icon
- `assets/splash.png` (1284x2778) - Splash screen
- `assets/adaptive-icon.png` (1024x1024) - Android adaptive icon
- `assets/favicon.png` (48x48) - Web favicon

For now, you can:
1. Use Expo's default assets from a template project, or
2. Create simple colored squares as temporary placeholders

To create temporary placeholders quickly, you can use any image editor or online tool to create:
- Icon: 1024x1024 with #38bdf8 background and a white "Z"
- Splash: 1284x2778 with #0f172a background and centered white "ZeroG Finance" text
- Adaptive icon: 1024x1024 with transparent background and cyan "Z"
- Favicon: 48x48 with #38bdf8 background

The app will run without these, but you'll see warnings in the console.
